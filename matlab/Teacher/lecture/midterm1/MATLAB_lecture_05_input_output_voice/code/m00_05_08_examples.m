There are a set of curves in the above form. 
Their coefficients, a and b, are stored in 
two vectors A and B, respectively. Draw all the curves.
Thus, A(i) and B(i) define one curve:

y = A(i) x2 + B(i), 
for 1 <= i <= the total number of curves.

Assume A = [-5:1:5], and B = [-10:2:10].

x = [-10:0.05:10];
