Debug
Debug the program.
The program show a mesh z.
z = 2 e^(-(y-5)^2) sin(x) + e^(-x^2) cos(y)

It performs smoothing to the mesh each time after ENTER
is pressed. Please watch the demo video.

Show a message 'Press ENTER to continue.' to remind a user 
to press ENTER after the mesh is drawn.

To perform a smoothing operation, 
the z value of an interior point (exclude the boundary points)
is the average of 3x3 grid points centered at the point.
do not change the z values of all the bondary points.

zlim is set to [-2,2].
